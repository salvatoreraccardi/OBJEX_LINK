## What is OBJEX Link?
Is a modular IoT board, is designed for **IoT devices** that are easy to repair and reusable at the end of the device life cycle. 
OBJEX Link is designed to suit a wide range of uses: **Smart Home & Cities, IIOT, Everyday things & Wearables, Predictive Maintenance, Agriculture Automation.**

It is also perfect for **rapid prototyping**, **advanced research projects**, and **robotics projects**, with the right module you can extend the possible uses of the board.

The compact form factor and board design ensure easy use and maintenance of the board. The architecture of OBJEX Link is composed of two parts, the first is the mainboard (OBJEX Link) and the second is the module allows for easy customization and interfacing with hardware compared to other IoT boards.
