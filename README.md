## What is OBJEX Link?
OBJEX Link is a modular IoT board. It is designed to develop IoT devices, which are easy to repair and reusable at the end of the device life cycle. The form factor of OBJEX Link is meant to fit several applications like(IoT button, security camera, motor driver, etc). With modules, the user can customize easily the hardware for your projects. 

OBJEX Link is composed of a mainboard(microcontroller + WiFi and Bluetooth) and modules(Sensor, Relay, Driver, Camera, Display, etc).

OBJEX Link v1.0 and v1.5 are based on ESP32-PICO-D4 microcontroller, to program the board you can use Arduino IDE, MicroPython, or other similar solutions.

## What I can do with OBJEX Link?
The applications of OBJEX Link are so many, but obviously, they are limited by the number of modules available. So here's what you can currently do with the modules developed so far:


### Prototype application with custom socket

All modules are open source so you can take inspiration from existing modules to develop modules for your projects.

## Do you want an OBJEX Link board?

The first 10 kits will be distributed in July.
