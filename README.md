## What is OBJEX Link?
OBJEX Link is a modular IoT board. It is designed to develop IoT devices, which are easy to repair and reusable at the end of the device life cycle. The form factor of OBJEX Link is meant to fit several applications like(IoT button, security camera, motor driver, etc). With modules, the user can customize easily the hardware for your projects. 

OBJEX Link is composed of a mainboard(microcontroller + WiFi and Bluetooth) and modules(Sensor, Relay, Driver, Camera, Display, etc).

OBJEX Link v1.0 and v1.5 are based on ESP32-PICO-D4 microcontroller, to program the board you can use Arduino IDE, MicroPython, or other similar solutions.

## What can I do with OBJEX Link?

The possible uses of OBJEX Link are endless, if you need a very compact and reliable hardware for your IoT devices, OBJEX Link is the best choice. OBJEX Link has one goal, to make the hardware in IoT devices easy to reuse. Connecting devices is very important to build the society of the future but respecting the environment is even more important.

## Do you want an OBJEX Link board?

The first 10 kits will be distributed in July.
