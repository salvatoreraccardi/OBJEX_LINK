## What is OBJEX Link?
OBJEX Link is a modular IoT board. It is designed to develop **IoT devices** that are **easy to repair** and **recycle**. OBJEX Link is designed to meet a wide range of uses: **Smart Home & Cities, IIOT, Everyday things & Wearables, Predictive Maintenance, Agriculture Automation.**

OBJEX Link can also be used for **rapid prototyping, and developing research and robotics projects, with the right module you can extend the possible uses of the board.**

The compact form factor and board design ensure easy use and maintenance of the board. The architecture of OBJEX Link is composed of two parts, the first is the mainboard (OBJEX Link) and the second is the module allows for easy customization and interfacing with hardware compared to other IoT boards.
