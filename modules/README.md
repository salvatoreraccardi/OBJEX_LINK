# OBJEX Modules
Modules are an essential element of OBJEX Link. In fact, they are the modules that allow OBJEX Link to detect the temperature, control an motor etc - *(like Arduino shields but smaller and more compact)*.

**Here are some features/components you can add with modules:**
- Sensors
- Relay 
- Motor driver(Stepper Motor, DC, LRA, ERM).
- OLED Display
- Convert slimstack connectors to larger connectors (type 2.54mm pitch connectors).
- A specific circuit (such as LoRa Module, PSRAM, PWM controller, etc).

## Types of modules
There are several form formats to ensure maximum customization.

| Type | Description     | Size    | PCB thickness | Connector | Connector Type | 3V3 | 5V | A |
|------|-----------------|---------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----|----|---|
| M0   | Standard Module | 10x20mm | 0.8mm         | 2         |  BM28B0              |  ✓   |  ✓  | 5 |
| M1   | Standard Module | 20x20mm | 0.8mm         | 4         |  BM28B0              |  ✓   |  ✓  | 5 |
| M1E   | With I2C EEPROM | 20x20mm | 0.8mm         | 4         |  BM28B0              |  ✓   |  ✓  | 5 |
